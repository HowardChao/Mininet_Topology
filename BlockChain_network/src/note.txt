Forwarding table:
1. intra table: {dest: next node id}
For nongateway node, find which gateway is the closest-->set it as the default gateway

2. inter table: {AS number: path}
Add fake edge for gateways in the same AS
Find the shortest path length of each gateway in the corrosponding AS-->corrosponding path

gateway: 2 table, intra and inter
nongateway: 1 table, intra. 

LogictoSendPacket:
1. If node[a]['AS number'] != node[c]['AS number'], send to the default gateway
2. Once enter the gateway, according to the inter table, we will get a corrosponding path
3. If the nth node and n+1 node in the path have same AS number, use the intra table
   Else, directly send to node n+1

Progress:
Extract the edges of gateways and create a new graph to compute the InterTable
